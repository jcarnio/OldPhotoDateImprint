# OldPhotoDateImprint
 A Python project, using Azure AI resources to recover those old date imprints from scanned photos and update the exif metadata.
 Contributors are Welcome!

Currently I am unable to recover the imprint dates in red.
I did a test by applying the date in white text on the photo and it worked.
